Made for the Minecraft@Home project

This mod allows you to rotate your player's viewpoint by single-pixel increments (one tap of an arrow key moves your head the exact same amount as moving your mouse exactly one pixel). This was designed primarily for reconstructing minecraft screenshots, but you may find it useful for something else!
